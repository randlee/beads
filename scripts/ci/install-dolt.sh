# Install a pinned Dolt CLI. Every CI job that needs `dolt` on PATH must go
# through this script instead of piping the upstream install.sh from
# releases/latest, because "latest" silently changes the binary under test.
#
# Keep this version in sync with internal/testutil/testdoltcommon.go:
# DoltDockerImage and scripts/ci/pull-dolt-image.sh. Tests run the CLI (the
# per-test sql-server that doltserver.Start launches) and the container
# side by side against the same databases; letting the two drift means the
# suite is exercising a Dolt pair no release ever shipped.
#
# Why pinned rather than latest: Dolt 2.3.0 (released 2026-08-13) regressed
# CALL DOLT_RESET('--hard') so that roughly one freshly created database in
# twenty comes up with the procedure permanently broken --
# "Error 1105 (HY000): context canceled" on every connection, from any
# session, for the life of the server process. Measured 2026-08-20 by
# creating fresh databases and immediately calling the procedure: 2.1.8 0/40
# broken, 2.2.0 0/60, 2.3.0 3/60, 2.3.1 3/100. That is what made
# TestFreshBootstrapHealIncarnation fail on a coin flip the day
# releases/latest moved to 2.3.x, and it also puts bd dolt compact/flatten
# and the #4566 fresh-bootstrap heal at risk on 2.3.x. Raise this pin only
# once a Dolt release is confirmed clean by that same measurement.
